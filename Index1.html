  <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>

  <p>I do not have any specific hobby, but I love spending my free time by sleeping and 
    watching TikTok. However, to appear cool, I would rather say that I love spending my time writing my thoughts.</p>

  <p> Italy: &nbsp;<i>Think again</i></p>

  <p>underline text:&nbsp;<u>How to reject a guy if you are already commited ?</u> </p>

  <p>strikethrough text:&nbsp;  <s>I have a boyfriend. </s> &nbsp; I want to focus on myself.</p>
